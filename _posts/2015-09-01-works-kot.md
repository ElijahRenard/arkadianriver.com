#### Summary

I was commissioned by Ronin Game Studios to bring a game concept to life. After understanding the client's request, I benchmarked competitors such as DraftKings.com and designed detailed flowcharts.

After approval of the human-centered experience, I began to produce and export assets for integration by the developers.

King of Trading /Â MVP of Trading was released in September 2015 on iOS and Android.
