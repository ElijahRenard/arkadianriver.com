#### Tasks

- Create human-centered experience by designing detailed flowcharts and advanced wireframes;
- Produce, animate and integrate in-game objects;
- Level design trading floors and animations;

#### Summary

I was commissioned by Ronin Game Studios to bring a game concept to life. After understanding the client's request, I designed detailed flowcharts and delivered a UX document.

A few weeks later, I was commissioned a second time to design game objects and trading floors.

In collaboration with the developers, I integrated the new game objects and animations.

Battle for Wall Street was released in July 2015 on iOS and Android.
