#### Summary

Inspired by the talented poet Maya Angelou, Rise celebrates the power that lives inside the bodies and souls of Black women and femmes.
Presented in collaboration with the one and only Cherrilyn Birchwood, Rise was created in late 2016, early 2017 by Shanice Nicole.
Riseâ€™s mission is to elevate Black women and femmes by fostering spaces where we can speak our truths, share our stories and be paid for it.
We believe we have the power to rise in solidarity: we simply have to share our resources, may these be money, time, energy or love.
